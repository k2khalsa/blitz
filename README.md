Blitz - Capstone Project

The future of transportation relies on self-driving electric vehicles to transform how people commute. Industry leaders, such as Waymo, Tesla, and Uber, have already announced ride-sharing services operated by fleets of self-driving vehicles, also known as “robo-taxis”. Although this technology is on the verge of fruition, much of its required infrastructure is underdeveloped. Blitz is addressing this need by creating an autonomous charging solution to ready existing EV charging stations for the emerging robo-taxi market. The future is now!  

In this repository you will find the perception model used detect and calculate position of a charge port in 3D space. This model uses the TensorFlow 1.13 setup.
